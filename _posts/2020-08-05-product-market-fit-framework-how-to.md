Product Market Fit is there science behind this voodoo artform? Apparently, there is. In this talk, I try and decipher frameworks and thinking process behind Product Market Fit. The talk would be useful for startup founders and early stage employees. 

The talk is about an hour and you can pause it at keep watching as the slides turn to the next ones.
