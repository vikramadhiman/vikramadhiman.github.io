I"Ä<p>Over the past few months, I have been receiving a steady stream of messages from business analysts, developers, product consultants, sales professionals asking for advice on how to transition to a Product Management Role (<a href="https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/product-management/what-is-the-role-of-a-product-manager" target="_blank">who is a product manager?</a>) in a tech company (<a href="https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/product-manager-in-tech/" target="_blank">product management in a tech company</a>). There are three main challenges that people have reported:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I work as a Product Consultant/ Analyst/ QA</li>
	<li>I donâ€™t work in a product company</li>
	<li>I donâ€™t have a tier 1 college on my resume</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we get started, it is worth thinking why do you want to transition to a Product Manager role. Remember, while a Product Manager role may look powerful, it often is opposite of that. Product Managers help the engineering team move faster and better. Product Managers must have the right balance of the right brain skills of empathy and creativity and the left brain skills of logic and analysis. Answer these questions for starters. Do you have a very high level of curiosity? Does using technology to solve problems fascinate you? Can you build a team that is passionate to work with you on solving problems? Do you think of ways to make products you useâ€Šâ€”â€ŠGoogle Maps, Notepads, Traffic Lights, better? Do you know how to balance your instincts with structured decision-making frameworks? Do you notice how products and systems influence human behaviour? If your answer to most of these answers is yes, you should consider a career in Product Management.</p>
