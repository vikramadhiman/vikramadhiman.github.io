I"x<p>13 years back (it is 12 January 2022 today) I was working on an online learning product where we had a particularly contentious product decision. When teachers conducted a public online class, students (13-17 years old) from across the world could join it by creating an account. Now, while in a class, should we allow students to check out other studentsâ€™ profiles and add them to their network? On its surface, this could result in network effects (this is when FB was all the rage). However, it could also be a privacy nightmare. There were strong arguments on both sides. As the debate raged over a period of time, people became increasingly attached to their point of view and the debate reached all the way to the CEO. Do you have similar stories? Have you seen any of these in your products:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Do you see conflicts in prioritization?</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Do most of your decisions go all the way up to executives?</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Do several deadlocks become discussions of anecdotes?</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Do competing objectives derail the aesthestics of your product?</strong></li>
</ul>
